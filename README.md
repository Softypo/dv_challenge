### Problem Statement
For a given input volumetric ultrasound image, give a corresponding estimation of the surface mesh.

Training dataset:
* 89 raw volumetric ultrasound images
* 5 reference 3D meshes, corresponding to the volumetric scans 001-005

Raw Volumetric Image Meta Info (for visualization and mesh alignment):
origin - (0, 0, 0)
spacing: (0.49479, 0.49479, 0.3125)
data type: unsigned short int
volume dimension: (768, 768, 1280)

Data Visualization:
We recommend using ParaView 5.9.1 for visualization purposes.
